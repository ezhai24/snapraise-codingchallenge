# snapraise-codingchallenge

### Synopsis
While plenty of to-do list applications already exist, they all tend to be overbearing in visual 
flair and features. As per my own needs, this will be a trimmed down, no-frills, simple to use, 
visually pleasing alternative.

### Specifications
This project was created for the Snap Raise weekend coding challenge. The task is as follows:

Create a simple to-do list web application! We will leave the requirements fairly broad to allow 
room for creativity and interpretation. Depending on your internrship focus, there are a few 
guildines to follow.

#### Front-End Focus
